        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine crackers, garlic salt, and ranch dressing mix in a resealable plastic bag; squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Finely crush crackers with a rolling pin or heavy skillet. Pour 1/3 the crumbs mixture into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour flour into a bowl. Pour eggs into another bowl.</li>
            <li>Gently press chicken pieces into flour to coat and shake off excess flour. Dip into beaten egg and press into cracker crumbs. Place the breaded chicken pieces onto a plate while breading the rest.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, cook breaded chicken in hot oil, turning once, until golden brown, no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, about 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
